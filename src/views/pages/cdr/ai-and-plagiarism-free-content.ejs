        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg text-center mb-8">
            Engineers Australia (EA) has strict requirements when it comes to the originality of content in your Competency Demonstration Report (CDR). The use of AI-generated content or plagiarized material can result in immediate rejection of your application. It's crucial to ensure that your CDR is 100% original and written by you, with no reliance on automated content generation tools.
        </p>
    
        <!-- Importance of Original Content -->

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-4">Why Original, Plagiarism-Free Content Matters</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Engineers Australia uses advanced plagiarism detection tools to verify the originality of your CDR. They also check for any signs of content generated using AI tools, which lack the personal touch and technical understanding required for an authentic CDR. Failing to meet these standards can lead to your application being rejected, which delays your migration process and wastes time and effort.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Plagiarism</strong> – Using content from other sources without proper citation or copying someone else’s CDR can lead to disqualification.</li>
                <li><strong>AI-Generated Content</strong> – Content generated by AI lacks personal experience and human insight, making it unsuitable for CDR submissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rejection</strong> – A CDR that includes plagiarized or AI-generated material will likely be rejected by Engineers Australia, requiring resubmission.</li>
