            One of the key components in your Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) is showcasing your ability to solve engineering problems. Engineers Australia assesses your competency based on how well you identify and resolve engineering challenges. Demonstrating problem-solving requires you to provide detailed accounts of specific issues, your analysis, and the engineering solutions you implemented.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                To meet Engineers Australia's requirements, you must clearly show how you applied your engineering knowledge to solve real-world problems. This involves detailing the steps you took, the obstacles you faced, and how your technical expertise allowed you to overcome these challenges. It's essential to describe specific examples where your solutions contributed to the success of a project.

                <li><strong>Identify the Problem</strong> – Clearly define the engineering issue that needed resolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze the Problem</strong> – Break down the problem, explore possible causes, and assess risks or potential challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Provide the Solution</strong> – Outline the engineering approach, techniques, and tools you used to solve the problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Demonstrate Results</strong> – Explain how your solution benefited the project and its outcomes.</li>
