    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-red-600 text-center mb-6">Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) Preparation Guide</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-8">
        The Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) is essential for engineers migrating to Australia. It showcases your engineering skills and achievements to Engineers Australia, ensuring you meet their standards. This guide explains how to prepare each section of your CDR, including Continuing Professional Development (CPD), Career Episodes, and the Summary Statement.
    </p>

    <!-- Continuing Professional Development (CPD) -->
    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-4">1. Continuing Professional Development (CPD)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Continuing Professional Development (CPD) keeps you updated with the latest advancements in your field. Your CPD listing should not exceed one A4 page and must be provided in list format. This list may include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>Formal post-graduate study</li>
            <li>Conferences you’ve attended or presented at</li>
            <li>Workshops, seminars, technical meetings, or technical inspections</li>
            <li>Preparation and presentation of material for professional courses, seminars, or symposia</li>
            <li>Volunteer work and mentoring services to the engineering profession</li>
            <li>Private study, including books, journals, and manuals</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            You do not need to include certificates from each course. Instead, focus on documenting your learning experiences and professional development activities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Writing Your Career Episodes -->
    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-4">2. Writing Your Career Episodes</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Each Career Episode is a detailed account of your engineering education or work experience. It highlights a specific period or distinct aspect of your engineering activity and demonstrates how you applied engineering knowledge and skills in the nominated occupation. You can base your Career Episode on:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>An engineering task undertaken as part of your educational program</li>
            <li>A project you have worked on or are currently working on</li>
            <li>A specific position you held, emphasizing the work you performed</li>
            <li>An engineering problem you solved</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Each Career Episode must be written in English, in your own words, and focus on your personal role. Avoid excessive technical material, such as calculations, photos, or tables. Each episode should be between 1,000 and 2,500 words and should follow this structure:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Introduction (100 words)</strong> – Dates, location, organization, and your role.</li>
            <li><strong>Background (200-500 words)</strong> – The context, project objectives, and your specific duties.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Engineering Activity (500-1000 words)</strong> – Your contribution, challenges faced, how you applied your engineering skills, and problem-solving strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Summary (50-100 words)</strong> – A reflection on the project's success and your role in its outcome.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Each episode should emphasize your personal involvement and how you applied your engineering knowledge. Remember to write in the first person ("I did..."), and avoid focusing on team activities.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Career Episode Requirements -->
    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-4">3. Career Episode Requirements</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Your Career Episodes should clearly demonstrate the application of your engineering skills. It is important that you focus on your role in the project, describing what you did and how you did it. Avoid generalizations like "we worked on..." and focus on your personal contributions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Important Points:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
            <li>Each episode should be a narrative, written in essay form. Do not use tables.</li>
            <li>Clearly identify engineering problems you faced and the solutions you applied.</li>
            <li>Your narrative should describe the tasks delegated to you and how you accomplished them.</li>
            <li>Highlight any technical difficulties and problem-solving techniques you used.</li>
            <li>Emphasize your personal contributions, including any creative or original work.</li>
            <li>Provide examples of how you worked with other team members.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Summary Statement Preparation -->
    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-4">4. Summary Statement Preparation</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Once your Career Episodes are complete, you must prepare a Summary Statement. The Summary Statement links the competencies demonstrated in your Career Episodes to the competency elements required by Engineers Australia. Each element should be cross-referenced with the relevant paragraph in your Career Episodes. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Number the paragraphs in your Career Episodes to make cross-referencing easier. The Summary Statement should include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li>A cross-reference to each competency element required for your occupation</li>
            <li>Specific examples from your Career Episodes to demonstrate your competencies</li>
            <li>The paragraph number where the competency is addressed</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            The Summary Statement templates are available on the Engineers Australia website. Only one Summary Statement is required for all three Career Episodes, and it should be submitted as part of your CDR application.
        </p>

    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-4">5. Important Notes</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
            <li>Your CPD list should be concise and must not exceed one A4 page.</li>
            <li>Each Career Episode should focus on your personal role and engineering contributions.</li>
            <li>Avoid excessive technical details in Career Episodes, such as large calculations, photos, or tables.</li>
            <li>The Summary Statement must cross-reference your Career Episodes with the required competencies.</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to compress the Summary Statement into one page. It should thoroughly cover all relevant competencies.</li>
        </ul>
