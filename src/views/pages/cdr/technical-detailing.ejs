        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg text-center mb-8">
            In a Competency Demonstration Report (CDR), technical detailing plays a crucial role in demonstrating your engineering knowledge and skills. Engineers Australia expects engineers to provide precise, well-organized technical details that reflect their competence and ability to apply engineering principles to real-world problems.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-4">Why Technical Detailing is Important</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Engineers Australia evaluates your CDR based on the technical depth and relevance of the content. Including clear and concise technical details shows your proficiency in using engineering concepts, tools, and techniques. It's not enough to merely describe your projects; you need to demonstrate how you applied technical knowledge to solve complex engineering problems.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Specific Technical Details:</strong> Include clear descriptions of the tools, methods, and engineering principles you applied to your tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Calculations:</strong> Where appropriate, provide engineering calculations and designs to support your work.</li>
                <li><strong>Application of Standards:</strong> Ensure that your work aligns with relevant engineering standards and best practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Approach:</strong> Present your technical knowledge in a well-organized, logical format that is easy for Engineers Australia to assess.</li>
